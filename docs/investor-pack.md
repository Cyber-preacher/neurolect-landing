title: Neurolect — Investor Teaser
subtitle: Signals → Policies → Safer Personalization
version: v0.1 (Sep 2025)
---

# 1. One-liner
Neurolect is the **policy runtime for personal AI**—turning raw, multi-modal **signals** into **safe, revocable, and portable intents** apps can trust.

# 2. Problem
- Apps need personalization but can’t safely touch sensitive signals.
- Users want control, revocation, and portability.
- Teams are re-implementing fragile heuristics across surfaces.

# 3. Solution
- **Signals → Processing → Intent Models → Policy Runtime → SDKs**.
- Clean **neurosignature schema**; consent + rate limits built-in.
- **On-device first**, cloud-assist where it adds value.

# 4. Why now
- Mature sensors + privately fine-tuned LLMs.
- Hardware capable of on-device inference.
- Privacy/product expectations converging.
- Cost curves (compute + memory) trending down.

# 5. Product (Runtime)
- Declarative policy engine.
- Deterministic envelopes for model I/O.
- Revocation + rotation primitives.
- Tenant-aware rate limiting.

# 6. Product (SDKs)
- **Web, iOS, Android, Node**.
- Drop-in guards for common UX (autofill, nudge, recap).
- Evaluations harness + driver plug-ins.

# 7. Tech & IP
- **Neurosignature schema** (typing, composability).
- **Policy engine** (deterministic, sandboxed).
- **Drivers** for signal sources.
- **Eval harness** with red/blue suites.

# 8. Safety & Ethics
- Explicit consent + per-intent scopes.
- Revocation as a first-class path.
- Stimulation guardrails & bounded autonomy.
- Audit envelopes; “why” traces for decisions.

# 9. Go-to-Market
- Start with **B2B2C**: fintech, productivity, health.
- Sell **SDK + runtime**; success-priced pilot to paid.
- Design partners → reference apps → marketplace.

# 10. Roadmap
- Q4’25: Prototype v1 + partner pilot.
- Q1’26: SDK alpha + eval harness public.
- Q2’26: Developer preview (policy runtime).
- Q3’26: GA with selected verticals.

# 11. Team
- Founders: systems + HCI + safety backgrounds.
- Advisors across privacy, policy, and product.

# 12. Ask
- Pre-seed/seed conversations.
- Design partners in productivity & health.
- Intros to privacy-forward enterprises.
